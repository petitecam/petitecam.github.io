            <p>I'm 20. I am from Marseille and I study at Kedge BS in a Msc in International Business. I am fan of Jul
                and listen him since 2013. He is amazing and I am part of his team, TeamJul. I'm one of his top 0.1%
                best fans.</p>

            <h1>Who is Jul?</h1>
            <p>Julien Marie (Jul) was born on January 14, 1990 in Marseille. He lived throughout his youth in Saint Jean du Désert, for
                a few years he has lived in Cassis. Jul is a role model for everyone, he worked very hard to get where
                he is now. He is the first salesman of French rap ever known. He left school in ninth grade and built
                swimming pools with his father. Since the beginning of his college Jul rapped in his room (he made his
                own beats, wrote his texts and rapped before recording). He broke into music with the sound Sort le
                cross volé released in 2014.</p>

            <p> He started by doing showcases in bars and chichas, then he performed in venues like the Dôme and this year
                he realized his dream of filling the Vélodrôme stadium on June 4th.
